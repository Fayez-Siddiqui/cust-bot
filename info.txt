Ask meanything!SearchBot is thinking...×Powered by Search Engine Land (andlove)CloseSEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, SEOmeans the process of improving your website to increase its visibility inGoogle, Microsoft Bing, and other search engines whenever people searchfor:Products you sell.Services you provide.Information on topics in which youhave deep expertise and/or experience.The better visibility your pages have insearch results, the more likely you are to be found and clicked on.Ultimately, the goal of search engine optimization is to help attract websitevisitors who will become customers, clients or an audience that keeps comingback.What you’ll learn in this guide:How SEO differs from SEM and PPCWhy SEOis importantSEO types and specializationsHow SEO worksHow to learn SEOHow isSEO different from SEM and PPC?SEM and PPC are two other common terms you willread about a lot here on Search Engine Land and hear about in the largersearch marketing community.Read on to learn more about both of these terms andhow they’re related to SEO.SEO vs. SEMSEM stands for search engine marketing –or, as it is more commonly known, search marketing.Search marketingis a typeof digital marketing. It is an umbrella term for the combination of SEO andPPC activities meant to drive traffic via organic search and paid search.Putsimply, search marketing is the process of gaining traffic and visibility fromsearch engines through both paid and unpaid efforts.So how do SEO and SEMdiffer? Technically they aren’t different – SEO is simply one-half of SEM:SEO= driving organic traffic from search engines.SEM = driving organic and paidtraffic from search engines.Now, this is where things get a bitconfusing.Today, many people use SEM interchangeably with PPC (which we’lltalk about in the next section).This idea seems to undercut SEO. However,SEOis marketing, just like PPC is marketing.Here’s the best way to think aboutSEO and SEM:Imagine SEM is a coin. SEO is one side of that coin. PPC is on theflip side.SEO vs. PPCPPCstands for pay-per-click – a type of digital marketingwhere advertisers are charged whenever one of their ads gets clickedon.Basically, advertisers bid on specific keywords or phrases that they wanttheir ads to appear for in the search engine results. When a user searches forone of those keywords or phrases, the advertiser’s ad will appear among thetop results.So again, if we think of search marketing as a coin, SEO and PPCare two sides of the same coin – SEO is the unpaid side, PPC is the paidside.Another key point: it’s important never to think of it as “SEO vs. PPC”(i.e., which one is better) because these are complementary channels. It’s notan either-or question – always choose both (as long as your budget allowsit).As we mentioned before, the terms SEM and PPC are used within the industryinterchangeably. However, that isn’t the case here on Search EngineLand.Whenever we mention “SEM,” it will be because we’re referring to both SEO(organic search) and PPC (paid search).If you’re curious about the historybehind how “SEM” came to mean “PPC” at the exclusion of SEO, you can digdeeper into these articles:How Wikipedia Turned PPC / Paid Search Into SEMDoesSEM = SEO + CPC Still Add Up?Why is SEO important?SEO is a critical marketingchannel. First, and foremost:organic search delivers 53% of all websitetraffic.That’s one big reason why the global SEO industry isforecastto reach astaggering $122.11 billion by 2028. SEO drives real business results forbrands, businesses and organizations of all sizes.Whenever people want to gosomewhere, do something, find information, research or buy a product/service –their journey typically begins with a search.But today,search is incrediblyfragmented. Users may search on traditional web search engines (e.g., Google,Microsoft Bing), social platforms (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) or retailer websites(e.g., Amazon).In fact, 61% of U.S. ﻿online shoppers start their productsearch on Amazon, compared to 49% who start on a search engine like Google.Also of note from that sameresearch:32% start on Walmart.com.20% start onYouTube.19% start on Facebook.15% start on Instagram.11% start onTikTok.Trillions of searchesare conducted every year. Search is often theprimary source of traffic for websites, which makes it essential to be “searchengine friendly” on any platform where people can search for your brand orbusiness.What this all means is that improving your visibility, and rankinghigher in search results than your competition, can positively impact yourbottom line,SEO is also incredibly important because the search engine resultspages (or SERPs) are super competitive – filled with search features (and PPCads). SERP features include:Knowledge panels.Featuredsnippets.Maps.Images.Videos.Top stories (news).People AlsoAsk.Carousels.Another reason SEO is critical for brands and businesses: unlikeother marketing channels, good SEO work is sustainable. When a paid campaignends, so does the traffic. Traffic from social media traffic is at bestunreliable – and a fraction of what it once was.SEO is the foundation ofholistic marketing, whereeverythingyour company does matters. Once youunderstand what your users want, you can then implement that knowledge acrossyour:Campaigns (paid and organic).Website content.Social media properties.SEOis a channel that drives the traffic you need to achieve key business goals(e.g., conversions, visits, sales). It also builds trust – a website thatranks well is generally regarded as authoritative or trustworthy, which arekey elements Google wants to reward with better rankings.Types of SEOThere arethree types of SEO:Technical SEO:Optimizing the technical aspects of awebsite.On-site SEO:Optimizing the content on a website for users and searchengines.Off-site SEO:Creating brand assets(e.g., ​​people, marks, values,vision, slogans, catchphrases, colors) and doing things that will ultimatelyenhance brand awareness and recognition (i.e., demonstrating and growing itsexpertise, authority and trustworthiness) and demand generation.You maintain100% control over content and technical optimizations. That’s not always truewith off-site (you can’t control links from other sites or if platforms yourely on end up shutting down or making a major change), but those activitiesare still a key part of this SEO trinity of success.Imagine SEO as a sportsteam. You need both a strong offense and defense to win – and you need fans(a.k.a., an audience). Think of technical optimization as your defense,content optimization as your offense, and off-site optimization as ways toattract, engage and retain a loyal fanbase.Technical optimizationOptimizingthe technical elements of a website is crucial and fundamental for SEOsuccess.It all starts with architecture – creating a website that can becrawled and indexed by search engines. As Gary Illyes, Google’s trendsanalyst, once put it ina Reddit AMA: “MAKE THAT DAMN SITE CRAWLABLE.”You wantto make it easy for search engines to discover and access all of the contenton your pages (i.e., text, images, videos). What technical elements matterhere: URL structure, navigation, internal linking, and more.Experience is alsoa critical element of technical optimization. Search engines stress theimportance of pages that load quickly and provide a good user experience.Elements such as Core Web Vitals, mobile-friendliness and usability, HTTPS,and avoiding intrusive interstitials all matter in technical SEO.Another areaof technical optimization is structured data (a.k.a., schema). Adding thiscode to your website can help search engines better understand your contentand enhance your appearance in the search results.Plus, web hosting services,CMS (content management system) and site security all play a role inSEO.Content optimizationIn SEO, your content needs to be optimized for twoprimary audiences: people and search engines. What this means is that youoptimize the content your audience will see (what’s actually on the page) aswell as what search engines will see (the code).The goal, always, is topublish helpful,high-quality content. You can do this through a combination ofunderstanding your audience’s wants and needs, data and guidance provided byGoogle.When optimizing content for people, you should make sure it:Coversrelevant topics with which you have experience or expertise.Includes keywordspeople would use to find the content.Is unique or original.Is well-written andfree of grammatical and spelling errors.Is up to date, containing accurateinformation.Includes multimedia (e.g., images, videos).Is better than yourSERP competitors.Is readable – structured to make it easy for people tounderstand the information you’re sharing (think: subheadings, paragraphlength, use bolding/italics, ordered/unordered lists, reading level, etc.).Forsearch engines, some key content elements to optimize for are:Title tagsMetadescriptionHeader tags (H1-H6)Image alt textOpen graph and Twitter CardsmetadataOff-site optimizationThere are several activities that may not be“SEO” in the strictest sense, but nonetheless can align with and helpcontribute indirectly to SEO success.Link building (the process of acquiringlinks to a website) is the activity most associated with off-site SEO. Therecan be great benefits (e.g., rankings, traffic) from getting a diverse numberof links pointing at your website from relevant, authoritative, trustedwebsites. Link quality beats link quantity – and a large quantity of qualitylinks is the goal.And how do you get those links? There are a variety ofwebsite promotion methods that synergize with SEO efforts. These include:Brandbuilding and brand marketing: Techniques designed to boost recognition andreputation.PR: Public relations techniques designed to earn editorially-givenlinks.Content marketing: Some popular forms include creating videos, ebooks,research studies, podcasts (or being a guest on other podcasts) and guestposting (or guest blogging).Social media marketing and optimization: Claimyour brand’s handle on any and all relevant platforms, optimize it fully andshare relevant content.Listing management: Claiming, verifying and optimizingthe information on any platforms where information about your company orwebsite may be listed and found by searchers (e.g., directories, review sites,wikis).Ratings and reviews: Getting them, monitoring them and responding tothem.Generally, when talking about off-site, you’re talking about activitiesthat are not going to directly impact your ability to rank from a purelytechnical standpoint.However, again, everything your brand does matters. Youwant your brand to be found anywhere people may search for you. As such, somepeople have tried to rebrand “search engine optimization” to actually mean“search experience optimization” or “search everywhere optimization.”SEOspecialtiesSearch engine optimization also has a few subgenres. Each of thesespecialty areas is different from “regular SEO” in its own way, generallyrequiring additional tactics and presenting different challenges.Five such SEOspecialties include:Ecommerce SEO: Additional SEO elements include optimizingcategory pages, product pages, faceted navigation, internal linkingstructures, product images, product reviews, schema and more.Enterprise SEO:This is SEO on a massive scale. Typically this means dealing with a website(or multiple websites/brands) with 1 million+ pages – or it may be based onthe size of the organization (typically those making millions or billions inrevenue per year). Doing enterprise also typically means delays trying to getSEO changes implemented by the dev team, as well as the involvement ofmultiple stakeholders.International SEO: This is global SEO for internationalbusinesses – doing SEO for multiregional or multilingual websites – andoptimizing for international search engines such as Baidu or Naver.Local SEO:Here, the goal is to optimize websites for visibility in local organic searchengine results by managing and obtaining reviews and business listings, amongothers.News SEO: With news, speed is of utmost importance – specificallymaking sure you get into Google’s index as quickly as possible and appear inplaces such as Google Discover, Google’s Top Stories and Google News. There’sa need to understand best practices for paywalls, section pages, news-specificstructured data, and more.How does SEO work?If you found this page via Googlesearch, you likely searched Google for [what is seo] or [seo].This guide ispublished on Search Engine Land, an authoritative website with great expertiseon and experience in the topic of SEO (we’ve been covering all SEO changes,big and small since 2006).Originally published in 2010, our “what is SEO” pagehas earned a whopping 324,203 links.Put simply, these factors (and others)have helped this guide earn a good reputation with search engines, which hashelped it rank in Position 1 for years. It has accumulated signals thatdemonstrate it is authoritative and trustworthy – and therefore deserves torank when someone searches for SEO.But let’s look at SEO more broadly. As awhole, SEO really works through a combination of:People:The person or teamresponsible for doing or ensuring that the strategic, tactical and operationalSEO work is completed.Processes:The actions taken to make the work moreefficient.Technology:The platforms and tools used.Activities:The end product,or output.Many other things factor into how SEO works. What follows is a high-level look at the most important knowledge and process elements.Six criticalareas, in combination, make SEO work:1. Understanding how search enginesworkSimply, if you want people to find your business via search – on anyplatform – you need to understand the technical processes behind how theengine works – and then make sure you are providing all the right “signals” toinfluence that visibility.When talking about traditional web search engineslike Google, there are four separate stages of search:Crawling:Search enginesuse crawlers to discover pages on the web by following links and usingsitemaps.Rendering:Search engines generate how the page will look using HTML,JavaScript and CSS information.Indexing:Search engines analyze the content andmetadata of the pages it has discovered and add them to a database (thoughthere’s no guarantee every page on your website will beindexed).Ranking:Complex algorithms look at a variety of signals to determinewhether a page is relevant and of high-enough quality to show when searchersenter a query.But optimizing for Google search is different from optimizingfor search other platforms like YouTube or Amazon.Let’s take Facebook, forexample, where factors such as engagement (Likes, comments, shares, etc.) andwho people are connected to matter. Then, on Twitter, signals like recency,interactions, or the author’s credibility are important.And furthercomplicating things: search engines have added machine learning elements inorder to surface content – making it even harder to say “this” or “that”resulted in better or worse performance.2. ResearchingResearch is a key partof SEO. Some forms of research that will improve SEO performanceinclude:Audience research:It’s important to understand your target audience ormarket. Who are they (i.e., their demographics and psychographics)? What aretheir pain points? What questions do they have that you can answer?Keywordresearch:This process helps you identify and incorporate relevant and valuablesearch terms people use into your pages – and understand how much demand andcompetition there is to rank for these keywords.Competitor research:What areyour competitors doing? What are their strengths and weaknesses? What types ofcontent are they publishing?Brand/business/client research:What are theirgoals – and how can SEO help them achieve those goals?Website research:Avariety of SEO audits can uncover opportunities and issues on a website thatare preventing success in organic search. Some audits to consider: technicalSEO, content, link profile and E-E-A-T.SERP analysis:This will help youunderstand the search intent for a given query (e.g., is it commercial,transactional, informational or navigational) and create content that is morelikely to earn rankings or visibility.3. PlanningAn SEO strategy is your long-term action plan. You need to set goals – and a plan for how you will reachthem.Think of it your SEO strategy as a roadmap. The path you take likely willchange and evolve over time – but the destination should remain clear andunchanged.Your SEO plan may include things such as:Setting goals (e.g., OKRs,SMART) and expectations (i.e., timelines/milestones).Defining and aligningmeaningful KPIs and metrics.Deciding how projects will be created andimplemented (internal, external or a mix).Coordinating and communicating withinternal and external stakeholders.Choosing and implementingtools/technology.Hiring, training and structuring a team.Setting abudget.Measuring and reporting on results.Documenting the strategy andprocess.4. Creating and implementingOnce all the research is done, it’s timeto turn ideas into action. That means:Creating new content:Advising yourcontent team on what content needs to be created.Recommending or implementingchanges or enhancements to existing pages:This could include updating andimproving the content, adding internal links, incorporatingkeywords/topics/entities, or identifying other ways to optimize itfurther.Removing old, outdated or low-quality content:The types of contentthat aren’t ranking well, driving converting traffic or helping you achieveyour SEO goals.5. Monitoring and maintainingYou need to know when somethinggoes wrong or breaks on your website. Monitoring is critical.You need to knowif traffic drops to a critical page, pages become slow, unresponsive or fallout of the index, your entire website goes offline, links break, or any othernumber of potential catastrophic issues.6. Analyzing, assessing and reportingon performanceIf you don’t measure SEO, you can’t improve it. To make data-driven decisions about SEO, you’ll need to use:Website analytics:Set up anduse tools (at minimum, free tools such as Google Analytics,Google SearchConsoleand Bing Webmaster Tools) to collect performance data.Tools andplatforms:There are many“all-in-one” platforms(or suites) that offer multipletools, but you can also choose to use only select SEO tools to trackperformance on specific tasks. Or, if you have the resources and none of thetools on the market do exactly what you want, you can make your owntools.After you’ve collected the data, you’ll need to report on progress. Youcan create reports using software or manually.Performance reporting shouldtell a story and be done at meaningful time intervals, typically comparing toprevious report periods (e.g., year over year). This will depend on the typeof website (typically, this will be monthly, quarterly, or some otherinterval),SEO is ongoingSEO never ends. Search engines, user behavior and yourcompetitors are always changing. Websites change and move (and break) overtime. Content gets stale. Your processes should improve and become moreefficient.Bottom line: There’s always something you can be monitoring, testingor improving. Or, as Bruce Clay put it:SEO will only be done when Google stopschanging things and all your competition dies.How to learn SEONow that youunderstand more about what SEO is and how it works – how can you learnmore?Reading (or, if you prefer, watching or listening to) the latest SEOnews, research, best practices and other developments should become one ofyour regular habits, whether it’s daily, weekly or monthly. You should alsoinvest in attending at least one or two events per year.The expectations andbehavior of searchers are constantly evolving, which means algorithms areconstantly changing to keep up. That, in combination with new breakthroughs intechnology (look no further than the explosive rise of ChatGPT in late 2022and the sudden addition of generative AI to search results in 2023).Here aresome trusted resources and tips to help you grow as an SEO professional.SearchEngine Land’s SEO resourcesSearch Engine Land has been covering SEO since2006.

Essentially,you’re paying for targeted visits to your website (or landing page or app).When PPC is working correctly, the fee is trivial because the click is worthmore than what you pay for it. For example, if you pay $3 for a click, but theclick results in a $300 sale, then you’ve made a hefty profit.PPC ads come indifferent shapes and sizes (literally), and can be made up of text, images,videos, or a combination. They can appear on search engines, websites, socialmedia platforms, and more.Search engine advertising (also known as paid searchor search engine marketing) is one of the most popular forms of PPC. It allowsadvertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine’s sponsored links whensomeone performs a search related to their business offering.

The Google Ads platform enablesbusinesses to create ads that appear on Google’s search engine and otherGoogle properties.Every time a search is initiated, Google digs into the poolof ads and chooses a set of winners to appear on that search engine resultspage.The “winners” are chosen based on a combination of factors, including thequality and relevance of their keywords and ad campaigns, as well as the sizeof their keyword bids. We’ll explain that in the next section.How PPC works inGoogle AdsWhen advertisers create an ad, they choose a set of keywords totarget with that ad and place a bid on each keyword. So if you bid on thekeyword “pet adoption,” you are telling Google you want your ad to appear forsearches that match or are related to pet adoption (more on keyword matchtypes here).Google uses a set of formulas and an auction-style process todecide which ads get to appear for any one search. If your ad is entered intothe auction, it will first give you a Quality Score from one to 10 based onyour ad’s relevance to the keyword, yourexpected click-through rate, andlanding page quality.It will then multiply your Quality Score by your maximumbid (the most you’re willing to pay for a click on that ad) to determineyourAd Rank. The ads with the highest Ad Rank scores are the ones thatshow.This system allows winning advertisers to reach potential customers at acost that fits their budget. It’s essentially a kind of auction. The belowinfographic illustrateshow the Google Ads auction works.Learn more in our postonHow Does Google Ads Work?How to do PPC with Google AdsConducting PPCmarketing through Google Ads is particularly valuable because, as the mostpopular search engine, Google gets massive amounts of traffic and thereforedelivers the most impressions and clicks to your ads.

Define Your Goals & AudienceBefore creating any content,you need to know two things: your goals and your audience.Yourgoalsare thespecific outcomes you want to achieve with your content marketing.For example,you might want to increase site traffic by a certain percentage or drive aspecific number of leads.Youraudienceis the group of people you want yourcontent to reach.For example, you might want to target small business owners,freelancers, bloggers, or students.A quick way to find your target audience isto use a tool likeOne2Target.Just enter up to five competitors’ domains andthe tool will gather information about their audiences’ demographics,socioeconomics, and behavior.Like this:Here are some additional steps you cantake to define your goals and audience:Review your current performance. Whatare your strengths and weaknesses? What are your opportunities andthreats?Identify your idealcustomer persona. Who are they? What are their painpoints, needs, and desires? How can you help them?Conduct acompetitoranalysis. Who are your main competitors? What are they doing well and poorly?How can you differentiate yourself from them?Set the right types of goals.Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals makeit easy to see whether you’re on track. For example, a SMART goal could be:“Increase organic traffic by 50% in the next six months.”Choose keyperformance indicators (KPIs) that measure progress. For example, some commonKPIs for content marketing are views, bounce rate, average engagement time,social shares, comments, email subscribers, etc.By defining your goals andaudience, you’ll have a clear direction and focus for your contentmarketing.You’ll also be able to create content that resonates with yourtarget audience and helps you achieve your desired results.Furtherreading:Target Audience: What It Is & How to Find Yours [+ Examples]SEO KPIs:12 KPIs for SEO to Track & Measure2. Determine Appropriate Content TypesYou’vedefined your goals and audience. Now, you need to choose the best contenttypes for your content marketing efforts.Content types are the formats andstyles of your content.We discussed some of these earlier, including:BlogpostsEbooksVideosPodcast episodesWebinarsCase studiesDon’t know where tostart?A great way is to reverse-engineer your competitors’ content strategies.See what’s working for them and replicate it in a better way.OpenOrganicResearch, enter any competitor’s domain, and head to the “Pages” tab.This is alist of that competitor’s pages, conveniently sorted by the estimated organictraffic they each bring in.Click the icon next to the URL to see the actualpage.Browse through a few of the top pages. Repeat this process for your maincompetitors. And look for patterns.For example:Do they use lots of visualassets?Is the content mostly long-form or short-form?Are the URLs mostlylanding pages, ebooks, case studies, or something different?Use the answers tothese questions to guide your choice of content type.You can also review yourcompetitors' social media accounts in a similar way.Here are some additionaltips for deciding which content types to use:Align content types with yourgoals. Different content types have different purposes and benefits. Forexample, blog posts are great for driving traffic, ebooks are great forgenerating leads, videos are great for increasing engagement, etc.Aligncontent types with your audience. Some content types appeal to differentaudiences. For example, some audiences prefer visual content, some preferaudio content, some prefer interactive content, etc.Experiment and optimize.You don’t need to stick to one content type. Mix and match to see what worksbest. Track KPIs and adjust accordingly.3. Set a Content BudgetNext, you needto set a content budget.Your content budget is the amount of money you’re ableto spend on your content marketing as a whole. It includes the costs ofcreating, distributing, and promoting your content.But how do you set acontent budget that works for your business?Start here:Estimate content costs.Do some research to see roughly how much it would cost to producecontent—think hiring writers, designers, editors, etc.Estimate distributioncosts. These are the costs of getting your content in front of your audience,such as paying for ads, creating sponsored posts, leveraging influencermarketing, etc.Calculate your predicted return on investment (ROI): TheROI ofyour digital content marketingis a metric that shows your content revenuerelative to your content costsAdjust your content budget accordingly. Based onyour estimated costs and ROI, decide how much you can allocate to differentcontent types and channelsBy setting a content budget, you’ll be able to planand manage your content marketing more efficiently and effectively.4. Decideon Distribution ChannelsNow you need to decide which places todistributecontentto. Places where your audience hangs out and consumescontent.How?There’s no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your niche,audience, goals, and resources.But here are some general tips you canfollow:Start with your own channels. These are channels you control like yourwebsite, blog, email list, social media profiles, etc. They’re the easiest andmost cost-effective ways to distribute your content and build anaudience.Expand to earned and paid channels. These are the channels you don’town but can leverage. Like guest posting, podcasting, influencer marketing,media outreach, etc. They can help you reach new audiences, generate backlinks(links from other sites that point to yours), and increase your authority andcredibility.Test and optimize. You don’t need to be everywhere. You need to bewhere it matters. So, test different channels to see what works best for you.Measure your results and optimize your content and strategyaccordingly.Further reading:SEO and Content Marketing: How to Combine ThemEffectively5. Decide on Your Content ScheduleIt’s time to decide on thefrequency of your content creation and distribution efforts.For example, youmight want to publish a blog post every week, a podcast every month, and awebinar every quarter.Then, you need to schedule those in acontent calendartosee exactly what you’ll create and when you’ll create it.Like this examplefrom ourcontent calendar template:To start, follow these tips:Assess yourresources and capacity. What does your content budget look like? How manypeople are involved in your content team? What are their roles andresponsibilities?Balance quality and quantity.
